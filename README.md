# Phase 3 CLI Project 

The purpose of this project is to help those who don't know what to cook, figure out wha they can make, with what ingredients are on hand. You will be able to pick and ingredient and see what recipes have that ingredient and pick a recipe to see if you have all of the ingredients required to create it.

To initialize our project run-
```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
